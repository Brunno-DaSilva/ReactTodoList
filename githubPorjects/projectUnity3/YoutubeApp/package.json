  "description": "This app was created by The React Junkies-- Bruno \"Baddy\" DaSilva, Caroline \"Catastrophe\" Nolasco, and John \"Juicy\" Martin. It was their first team-React-app-build together, but they seemed to have conquered it masterfully. This application is a learning web site for Web developers developed with React. It uses a Youtube API call to fetch and display Youtube web developer tutorials. The Learn by Youtube app featured courses like HTML&CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, ReactJS and much more.",
