# Learn by Youtube

This app was created by The React Junkies-- Bruno "Baddy" DaSilva, Caroline "Catastrophe" Nolasco, and John "Juicy" Martin. It was their first team-React-app-build together, but they seemed to have conquered it masterfully. This application is a learning web site for Web developers developed with React. It uses a Youtube API call to fetch and display Youtube web developer tutorials. The Learn by Youtube app featured courses like HTML&CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, ReactJS and much more. 

## About Bruno DaSilva
   Bruno is a dad and he's soft spoken and he's a fantastic coder-- especially on the front-end. This app would probably be truly stunning if he was in charge of all the CSS.
